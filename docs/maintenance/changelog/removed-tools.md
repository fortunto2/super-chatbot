# Removed AI Tools Summary

This document summarizes the AI tools and features that have been removed to focus the application on core media generation capabilities.

## Removed Tools

### 1. Weather Tool (`get-weather.ts`) ❌ Deleted
**Location**: `lib/ai/tools/get-weather.ts`

**What it did**: 
- Fetched current weather data for specified locations
- Displayed weather information in a visual component
- Supported geolocation-based weather queries

**Removed from**:
- Tool registration in `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`
- Active tools list in the chat API
- Import statements and references

### 2. Code Execution Artifact ❌ Deleted
**Location**: `artifacts/code/`

**What it did**:
- Python code execution in the browser using Pyodide
- Interactive code editing with syntax highlighting
- Real-time output display including matplotlib plots
- Code manipulation tools (run, copy, add comments/logs)

**Removed files**:
- `artifacts/code/client.tsx` - React component for code execution
- `artifacts/code/server.ts` - Server-side code artifact handler

**Removed from**:
- Artifact definitions in `components/artifact.tsx`
- Document handlers in `lib/artifacts/server.ts`
- Artifact kinds in type definitions

### 3. Weather Component ❌ Deleted
**Location**: `components/weather.tsx`

**What it did**:
- Visual weather display with temperature, high/low, hourly forecast
- Day/night theming based on sunrise/sunset times
- Responsive mobile/desktop layouts
- Integration with weather tool results

**Removed from**:
- Component imports in `components/message.tsx`
- Tool result rendering in message components

## Updated Type Definitions

### Before:
```typescript
export type ArtifactKind = 'code' | 'image' | 'text' | 'sheet' | 'resolution';
export const artifactKinds = ['text', 'code', 'image', 'sheet', 'video'] as const;
```

### After:
```typescript
export type ArtifactKind = 'image' | 'text' | 'sheet' | 'video';
export const artifactKinds = ['text', 'image', 'sheet', 'video'] as const;
```

## Remaining AI Tools ✅ Kept

### Core Creative Tools:
1. **`configure-image-generation.ts`** - FLUX Pro/Dev image generation
2. **`configure-video-generation.ts`** - SuperDuperAI Veo3 video generation
3. **`create-document.ts`** - Document creation for all artifact types
4. **`update-document.ts`** - Document modification and editing
5. **`request-suggestions.ts`** - Contextual content suggestions

### Supporting Artifacts:
1. **Image Artifact** (`artifacts/image/`) - Image generation and display
2. **Video Artifact** (`artifacts/video/`) - Video generation and playback
3. **Text Artifact** (`artifacts/text/`) - Document editing and collaboration
4. **Sheet Artifact** (`artifacts/sheet/`) - Spreadsheet functionality

## Impact of Removal

### Benefits:
1. **Focused User Experience**: Clear emphasis on media creation capabilities
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer tools to maintain and debug
3. **Better Performance**: Removed heavy Pyodide dependency for code execution
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Eliminated unused weather API integrations

### Considerations:
1. **Code Execution**: Users can no longer execute Python code directly in chat
2. **Weather Queries**: Weather information is no longer available through the assistant
3. **Educational Use**: Reduced utility for programming education or demonstrations

## Future Considerations

### If Code Execution is Needed:
- Could be re-implemented as an external service
- Alternative: Link to online code editors (CodePen, Replit, etc.)
- Consider sandboxed execution environments

### If Weather is Needed:
- Could be re-implemented as a simple text-based response
- Integration with weather APIs without complex UI components
- Consider as a simple lookup tool rather than interactive widget

## Files Modified

### API Routes:
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Removed weather tool registration

### Components:
- `components/artifact.tsx` - Removed code artifact from definitions
- `components/message.tsx` - Removed weather component imports and rendering

### Type Definitions:
- `lib/artifacts/types.ts` - Updated ArtifactKind type
- `lib/artifacts/server.ts` - Removed code document handler

### Test Files (May Need Updates):
- `tests/prompts/basic.ts` - Contains weather test prompts
- `tests/e2e/chat.test.ts` - Has weather tool tests
- `tests/routes/chat.test.ts` - Weather tool test references

## Testing Notes

After removal, the following tests may need updates or removal:
- Weather tool functionality tests
- Code execution artifact tests
- Integration tests that depend on these features

The core media generation features (images, videos, text, sheets) remain fully functional and tested.

## Documentation Updates

This removal aligns with the updated application focus documented in:
- `docs/ai-media-capabilities.md` - Core AI capabilities overview
- `README.md` - Updated feature descriptions
- `components/suggested-actions.tsx` - Media-focused example prompts

The application now provides a clean, focused experience for AI-powered media creation without the complexity of general-purpose tools like code execution and weather lookup.
